# Installation

## Install from Docker

Lightpanda provides [official Docker
images](https://hub.docker.com/r/lightpanda/browser) for both linux amd64 and
arm64 architectures.

The following command fetches the Docker image and start a new container exposing Lightpanda's CDP server on port `9222`.

The `--privileged` option is required because the browser requires `io_uring` syscalls which are blocked by default by Docker.

```sh copy
$ docker run -d --name lightpanda -p 9222:9222 --privileged lightpanda/browser:nightly
```

## Install from the nightly builds

You can download the last binary from the [nightly
builds](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/releases/tag/nightly) for
Linux x86_64 and MacOS aarch64.

*For Linux*
```bash copy
curl -L -o lightpanda https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/releases/download/nightly/lightpanda-x86_64-linux && \
chmod a+x ./lightpanda
```

*For MacOS*
```sh copy
curl -L -o lightpanda https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/releases/download/nightly/lightpanda-aarch64-macos && \
chmod a+x ./lightpanda
```

*For Windows + WSL2*

The Lightpanda browser is compatible to run on Windows inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). If WSL has not been installed before follow these steps (for more information see: [MS Windows install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).
Install & open WSL + Ubuntu from an **administrator** shell:
  1. `wsl --install`
  2. -- restart --
  3. `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
  4. `wsl`

Once WSL and a Linux distribution have been installed the browser can be installed in the same way it is installed for Linux.
Inside WSL install the Lightpanda browser:
```bash copy
curl -L -o lightpanda https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/releases/download/nightly/lightpanda-x86_64-linux && \
chmod a+x ./lightpanda
```
It is recommended to install clients like Puppeteer on the Windows host.
