# Build from sources

## Prerequisites

Lightpanda is written with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `0.14.0`. You will have to
install it with the right version in order to build the project.

You need also to install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) for building deps.

Lightpanda also depends on
[zig-js-runtime](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/zig-js-runtime/) (with v8),
[Libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) and [html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever).

To be able to build the v8 engine for zig-js-runtime, you have to install some libs:

**For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux:**

```bash copy
sudo apt install xz-utils ca-certificates \
        pkg-config libglib2.0-dev \
        clang make curl git
```

**For MacOS, you need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and the following pacakges from homebrew:**

```bash copy
brew install cmake
```

## Install Git submodules

The project uses git submodules for dependencies.

To init or update the submodules in the `vendor/` directory:

```bash copy
make install-submodule
```

This is an alias for `git submodule init && git submodule update`.

## Build and run

You an build the entire browser with `make build` or `make build-dev` for debug
env.

But you can directly use the zig command to run in debug mode:

```bash copy
zig build run
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The build will download and build V8. It can takes a lot of time, more than
    1 hour.
    You can save this part by donwloading manually a
    [pre-built](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/zig-v8-fork/releases version)
    and use the `-Dprebuilt_v8_path=` option.
</Callout>

### Embed v8 snapshot

Lighpanda uses v8 snapshot. By default, it is created on startup but you can
embed it by using the following commands:

Generate the snapshot.
```bash copy
zig build snapshot_creator -- src/snapshot.bin
```

Build using the snapshot binary.
```bash copy
zig build -Dsnapshot_path=../../snapshot.bin
```

See [#1279](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/browser/pull/1279) for more details.
