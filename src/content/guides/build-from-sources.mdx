# Build from sources

## Prerequisites

Lightpanda is written with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `0.14.0`. You will have to
install it with the right version in order to build the project.
Lightpanda also depends on
[zig-js-runtime](https://github.com/lightpanda-io/zig-js-runtime/) (with v8),
[Netsurf libs](https://www.netsurf-browser.org/) and
[Mimalloc](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc).

<br />
To be able to build the v8 engine for zig-js-runtime, you have to install some libs:

**For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt install xz-utils \
    python3 ca-certificates git \
    pkg-config libglib2.0-dev \
    gperf libexpat1-dev \
    cmake clang
```

**For MacOS, you only need cmake:**

```bash
brew install cmake
```

## Install and build dependencies

### All in one build

You can run `make install` to install deps all in one (or `make install-dev` if you need the development versions).

Be aware that the build task is very long and cpu consuming, as you will build from sources all dependencies, including the v8 Javascript engine.

### Step by step build dependency

The project uses git submodules for dependencies.

To init or update the submodules in the `vendor/` directory:

```bash
make install-submodule
```
#### Netsurf libs

Netsurf libs are used for HTML parsing and DOM tree generation.

```bash
make install-netsurf
```

For dev env, use `make install-netsurf-dev`.

<br />
#### Mimalloc

Mimalloc is used as a C memory allocator.

```bash
make install-mimalloc
```

For dev env, use `make install-mimalloc-dev`.

Note: when Mimalloc is built in dev mode, you can dump memory stats with the
env var `MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1`. See
[https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/environment.html](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/environment.html).

<br />
#### zig-js-runtime

Our own Zig/Javascript runtime, which includes the v8 Javascript engine.

This build task is very long and cpu consuming, as you will build v8 from sources.

```bash
make install-zig-js-runtime
```

For dev env, use `make install-zig-js-runtime-dev`.
